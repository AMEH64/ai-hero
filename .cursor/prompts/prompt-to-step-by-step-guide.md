This file contains a prompt designed to be passed to an AI Agent to edit a codebase. This is part of a course where I provide several prompts in a row to create something from scratch.

I want you to take this prompt and turn it into a step-by-step article that a real human can follow, without the use of an AI Agent to help.

Add it under the heading of ## Human Instructions.

Each step should be numbered 1, 2, 3.
Each sub-step should be numbered 1.1, 1.2 etc.

Be extremely concise, and provide code samples where needed.
