## Quickstart

### Install PNPM

Because this course is _so big_ we're using `pnpm` as the package manager. It's like `npm`, but results in fewer `node_modules` saved to disk.

[Install `pnpm` globally](https://pnpm.io/installation).

### Install Dependencies

```sh
# Installs all dependencies
pnpm install

# Asks you which exercise you'd like to run, and runs it
pnpm run exercise
```
