DeepSearch vs DeepResearch

To begin day one you will need:

- A next js app With a simple front end, With premade components for messages and the chat. The app should be a shell, with not much going on.
- We may also need a component for showing tool calls.
- The app should have an example route which shows the components in use
- A next/auth setup with Discord enabled, but not yet set up
- A basic serper setup for searching the web (which users can delete if they're not using serper)
