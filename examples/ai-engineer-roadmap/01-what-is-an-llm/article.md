## Parameter Size

"To make the most out of the machines, most people choose the largest models that can fit in their machines. Most GPUs come with 16 GB, 24 GB, 48 GB, and 80 GB memory. So it's not a coincidence that many models today have 7 billion or 65 billion parameters - these models fit neatly into the memory of the most common GPUs." - Chip Huyen
