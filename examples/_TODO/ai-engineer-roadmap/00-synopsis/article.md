## Course Outline

Do you want to build AI-powered applications, but don't know where to start?

This course will give you an overview of the field. You'll understand all of the different tools in the AI Engineer's toolbox.

We won't get bogged down in the details. No linear algebra. We'll stay at a high level, understanding what each tool does and how it fits into the bigger picture. We can get hands-on later.

We won't be spending long on this - you'll be able to rattle through this tutorial in an hour.

By the end of this course you'll be able to participate in real conversations about AI engineering. When the next big thing breaks, you'll be able to understand how it fits into the AI landscape.

And you'll be ready to start diving into the practical side of the field, with my Vercel AI SDK free tutorial. That'll give you a hands-on introduction to building AI-powered applications.

Let's start your AI Engineering journey!
