Ready to build AI-powered applications but don't know where to start?

This tutorial gives you a clear map of the AI Engineer's toolkit. By the end, you'll understand the key components that power modern AI applications.

We'll keep it practical and accessible. No deep dives into linear algebra - we'll focus on understanding what each tool does and how it fits into real-world applications. The hands-on experience will come later.

This is a quick, focused overview - you can complete it in about an hour. By the end, you'll be equipped to engage in meaningful discussions about AI engineering. When the next breakthrough hits the news, you'll understand exactly where it fits in the broader AI ecosystem.

We'll learn about:

- How AI Models Work
- Choosing the right model for your app
- The mindset of an AI Engineer
- How to choose a technique to improve your app
- How to productionize and improve your app

Then you'll be ready to get your hands dirty with my [Vercel AI SDK](https://www.aihero.dev/vercel-ai-sdk-tutorial) tutorial, where you'll build your first AI-powered application from scratch.

Let's dive into the world of AI Engineering!
